# Why I Started Writing

I've resisted writing publicly for a long time.

Part of it was the usual anxiety: who's going to read this, and what do I actually have to say that isn't already out there? But mostly it was the feeling that I didn't have anything *finished* enough to share. Every idea felt half-baked, every opinion provisional.

What changed my mind was realizing that's exactly the point.

## Thinking Out Loud

The things I find most useful to read aren't polished whitepapers or perfectly reasoned arguments. They're people working through problems in real time — showing their thinking, not just their conclusions.

That's what I want to do here.

I work in data and systems. A lot of what I do day-to-day involves taking something messy and ambiguous and turning it into something structured and useful. SQL queries, dashboards, automation scripts — but also the upstream work: figuring out what question is actually worth answering, what metric actually matters, what the person using the tool actually needs.

That process is rarely clean, and I almost never see it written about honestly.

## What I'll Write About

Mostly the things I'm thinking about or working through:

- **Data and analysis** — how to ask better questions, when a dashboard helps vs. when it just adds noise, what I've learned building things people actually use
- **Systems thinking** — how I approach automation, process design, and making things less manual
- **Design** — specifically the overlap between data and design, where I think most interesting work happens
- **Miscellaneous** — things I've read, ideas I can't shake, lessons from running a business before I got into data

I'm not going to force a posting schedule. When I have something worth saying, I'll write it up.
